This is my personal portfolio site — a single-page app where I document how I approach real-world development work.

Most of my experience is in **internal tools, automation, and reporting** across government and enterprise environments. Because of that, you won’t find flashy demos or public source code here. Instead, the focus is on **how problems were approached, decisions made, and impact delivered**.

If you’re curious how I think, structure work, and ship things responsibly, this site is meant to give you a good sense of that.

**Live site:**

## Built With

- **React** — component-driven UI
- **Tailwind CSS** — layout, spacing, and typography
- **Motion (Framer Motion)** — purposeful transitions and layout animations
- **Vite** — fast dev + clean production builds
- **GitHub Pages** — deployment

## Design & Philosophy

The design is intentionally minimal and content-first. I wanted the site to feel:

- Calm
- Readable
- Structured
- Uncluttered

Some guiding principles:

- High-contrast **light and dark themes**
- A very small, consistent color palette
- Typography-driven layouts
- Motion used to **guide attention**, not decorate
- Fully responsive across desktop and mobile
- Respect for accessibility and reduced-motion preferences

The layout and motion are inspired more by **editorial sites and technical documentation** than traditional portfolio galleries.

## What’s Inside

The site includes:

- **Case studies** based on real internal projects
  (apps, automation, reporting, and tooling)
- A breakdown of **skills and workflows** I actually use
- **Experience & education** history
- **Contact info** and a downloadable resume

Because much of the work is internal, the emphasis is on:

- tradeoffs
- constraints
- reasoning
- outcomes

Not screenshots for the sake of screenshots.

## Notes

- This is a **single-page app** with animated section transitions
- Navigation swaps entire sections instead of scrolling
- Mobile UX is intentionally simplified (menus, hidden scrollbars, fewer distractions)
- The project is actively maintained and iterated on
