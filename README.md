This is my personal portfolio site, where I showcase my work as an application developer focused on internal tools, automation, and practical problem-solving.

The goal of the site is to keep things clear and easy to navigate, with case studies based on real projects from government and enterprise environments. Since most of my work is internal, the emphasis is on _approach, decisions, and impact_ rather than screenshots or source code.

**Live site:**  
https://sereneprince.github.io/noahpn/

## Built With

- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Motion**
- **Vite**

## Design & Approach

The design is intentionally minimal and content-first. I wanted the site to feel calm, readable, and focused, without unnecessary visual noise.

Some guiding principles:

- High-contrast light and dark themes
- A small, consistent color palette
- Typography-driven layouts
- Motion used to guide attention, not decorate
- Fully responsive with accessibility and reduced-motion support

The layout and motion are inspired by modern documentation sites and editorial layouts, where clarity matters more than flair.

## Content

The portfolio includes:

- Selected **case studies** from internal applications, automation, and reporting work
- A high-level overview of my skills and experience
- Contact information and a downloadable resume

Everything here is curated to reflect how I actually work and think through problems, rather than trying to cover every tool or technology I’ve ever touched.
