## Features

- **Minimalist Design**: The portfolio follows an extremely minimalist approach, focusing on typography and clean layouts.

- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, alt text, and semantic tags are used to ensure accessibility.
- **Projects**: Includes a variety of projects like _TipOff_, a Wordle-inspired game based on guessing NBA players.
- **Timer**: A simple timer in React with a HH:MM:SS format, along with pause and reset functionality.

## Technologies Used
