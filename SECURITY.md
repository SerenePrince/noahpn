## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability related to this site, its deployment, or its dependencies, please report it responsibly so I can address it.

**Contact:** noahparknguyen@gmail.com

Please do not open a public issue for security-related reports.

I will review reports as quickly as possible and follow up with next steps as appropriate.
